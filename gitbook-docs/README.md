# =nil; Proof Market

Generating SNARK/STARKS proofs is a compute-heavy task. These could take hours to compute.&#x20;

This would thus require any parties who are interested in a particular proof for a circuit to have to invest and maintain the infrastructure for proof computation which could lead to centralisation and specialisation of proof provisions.&#x20;

\= nil's proof market is a venue where anyone could post a request for proof for any pre-defined circuits and a price. Any party can offer to fill this request.&#x20;

We envision this is where the state-proof requesters and proof generators will meet and create a free, open and self-sustaining market.



{% hint style="info" %}
Initially, we expect the circuits on the proof market to be generated by using our zkLLVM compiler project. However, the goal of the marketplace is to enable any proofs from any system to be validated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Proof Market version represented here is alpha. We expect constant changes to the below as per the feedback we receive from participants.
