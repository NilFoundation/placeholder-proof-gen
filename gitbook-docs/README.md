# =nil; Proof Market

Generating SNARK/STARKS proofs is a compute heavy task.These could take hours to compute.&#x20;

This would thus require any parties who are interested in a particular of proof for a circuit to have invest and maintain the infrastructure for proof computation which could lead to centralisation of proof provisions.&#x20;

\=nil;s proof market is a venue where anyone could post a request for a proof for any of pre-defined circuits and a price. Any party can offer to fill this request.&#x20;

We envision this is where the state proof requesterâ€˜s and proof generators will meet and create a free ,open and self sustaining market.
