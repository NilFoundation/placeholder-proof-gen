# =nil; Proof Market

Generating SNARK/STARKS proofs is a compute heavy task.These could take hours to compute.&#x20;

This would thus require any parties who are interested in a particular  proof for a circuit to have invest and maintain the infrastructure for proof computation which could lead to centralisation and specialisation of proof provisions.&#x20;

\=nil;s proof market is a venue where anyone could post a request for a proof for any of pre-defined circuits and a price. Any party can offer to fill this request.&#x20;

We envision this is where the state proof requesterâ€˜s and proof generators will meet and create a free ,open and self sustaining market.



{% hint style="info" %}
Initially we expect the circuits on the proof market to be generated by using our zkLLVM compiler project. However , the goal of the market place is to enable any proofs from any system to be validated.
