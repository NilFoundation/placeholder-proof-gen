# Command Line

In this guide , we walk through all the steps to interact with the proof market. We will cover everything from compiling a circuit , placing/matching order , generating/verifying proof.

1. [Compile Circuit](command-line.md#compile-circuit)
2. [Push order to Proof Market](command-line.md#push-order-to-proof-market)
3. [Match Order & Generate Proof](command-line.md#match-order-and-generate-proof)
4. [Push Proof to the Proof Market](command-line.md#push-proof-to-proof-market)
5. [Verify Proof](command-line.md#push-proof-to-proof-market-1)
