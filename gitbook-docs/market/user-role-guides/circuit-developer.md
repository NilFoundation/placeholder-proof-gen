# Circuit Developer

This is an entity who prepare circuits for proof market. The most efficient way to create a circuit definition for Proof Market is [zkLLVM](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm). All dependencies and build instructions are inside the [zkLLVM's repository](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm).

Circuits can be generated by anyone. They are serialised & published on the proof market. This allows the reuse of the circuits by all other proof requesters.&#x20;

## Create a new circuit (using [zkLLVM](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm))

```
make -C ${ZKLLVM_BUILD:-build} <circuit target name> -j$(nproc)
```

## Prepare a statement with circuit description for Proof Market

Circuits are stored as a _statement_ structure on Proof Market. Statement description example can be found in /example directory

```
python3 scripts/prepare_statement.py -c <zkllvm output> -o <statement description file>
```

Provide the necessary information listed in the output statement file

## Publish to Proof Market

This statement can now be pushed to the Proof market via python script

```
python3 scripts/statement_tools.py push --file <json file with statement description> --auth <json authorization file>
```

Authorisation file examples can be found in /example directory.

You will be returned an object containing a _\_key_ filed -- unique descriptor of the statement

## Published circuit id

A list of all available statements can be obtained by

```
python3 scripts/statement_tools.py get
```
