# Overview

## Spot vs Futures

Every market place has a set of instruments. There are buyers and sellers in the market for each of these instruments. Example : London Stock Exchange allows users to buy/sell stocks of companies  or Binance allows users to buy/sell Bitcoin- these are known as spot markets as you own the commodity.&#x20;

Exchanges also allow buying/selling of a future price of the instrument. Example: Binance allows users to buy/sell future values of Bitcoin via perpetuals - these are know as derivative markets.

\=nil;'s proof market is more on the lines of a Spot Market rather than a speculative value of proof generation.

## Instruments/Circuits

As mentioned above, markets tend to arrive at a fair value for a instrument by interactions between buyers and sellers. In =nil's proof markets, the instruments are Circuits (initially generated by the zkLLVM). These circuits are serialised byte codes created by the proof system which was compiled with the zkLLVM compiler.&#x20;

## Entities

The marketplace consists of the following entities.

* **Proof Requester** : This can be an application like a bridge requesting balance or a user interested in cross cluster operation and/or trust-less data access.
* **Proof Generator** : This is an entity who will generate the proofs for the requests/orders made by the Proof Requester.

## Orders

* **Buy Order** : A buy order is posted by a proof requester. Each buy order comprises of the following parameters:
  * **Circuit** : The instruments
  * **Cost** : Amount the user is willing to pay for the proof. This is a number represented in USD.
  * **Order Time Out** : Once the order enters the market place, how long should it stay in the order book. If it times out before being matched , it is purged. This is a number representing   Minutes.
  *   **Generation Time**:  Once the order is matched, this specifies the maximum time the proof generator has to publish the proof. This is an optional parameter. This is a number expressed in minutes.&#x20;


*   **Sell Order**: A sell order is posted by a proof Generator. Each sell order comprises of the following parameters

    * Circuit:
    * Cost:
