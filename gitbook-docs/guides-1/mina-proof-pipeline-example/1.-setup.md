# Part 1. Setup

Mina proofs are computationally heavy; hence, proof producers can benefit from
using Proof Market to generate Mina state proofs for their further in-EVM validation.

You're going to need the following environments ready for this guide.

## Step 1: Proof Market

Prerequisites from the Proof Market side are:

* [Environment setup](../getting-started/environment-setup.md).
* [Proof Market toolchain installation and setup](../../getting-started/installation.md).
  You don't need to set up a virtual environment for the Proof Market toolchain,
  we will only be using its Python scripts.
  This directory will be referred to as `proof-market-toolchain` home in the guide.
* [Authentication on Proof Market](../../market/user-guides/sign-up.md).
  There's no need to register as a producer, any account will suffice.

## Step 2: Mina state proof

Mina state proof repository maintained by `=nil;` Foundation
comprises the following artifacts:
* Solidity EVM verifier;
* C++ circuits;
* scripts to fetch Mina state (ledger) and Mina account state (user/zkApp).

Clone the [Mina state proof repository](https://github.com/NilFoundation/mina-state-proof)
and run `npm i` from the project's directory to install all its dependencies.
This directory will be referred to as `mina-state-proof` home in the guide.

## Step 3: Mina zkApp

Mina zkApp project consists of a sample zkApp located at `mina-state-proof/examples/mina-add-zkapp`
with 8 state variables that are updated on each interaction.
This directory will be referred to as `mina-add-zkApp` home in the guide.

Follow the steps from
[`mina-add-zkapp/README.md`](https://github.com/NilFoundation/mina-state-proof/tree/master/examples/mina-add-zkapp)
to install the project dependencies.

After that, you should have the following three directories ready:

```bash
proof-market-toolchain/
mina-state-proof/
mina-state-proof/examples/mina-add-zkapp/
```
