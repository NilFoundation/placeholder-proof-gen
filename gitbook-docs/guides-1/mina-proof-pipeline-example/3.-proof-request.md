# 3. Proof Request

We will next collect the information required to submit a proof request for our data to be validated on EVM.

Please navigate to the `mina-state-proof` home directory.

## 1 . Get Public Input

### Ledger State Proof

To fetch the ledger data (entire mina network state), execute the following :&#x20;

```
python3 scripts/get_mina_state.py --output=mina_ledger_state.json ledger
```

The output file contains the `snarkedLedgerHash` attribute identifies the ledger hash; this will be used in the validation of the proof in the smart contract.

```
      "blockchainState": {
        ....
        "snarkedLedgerHash": "jwmapuNzu8YKee3RzbYQeWa5mqj1LoMiPohBEc3pfyR9gN3csQ5",

      }
```

### Account State Proof

To fetch the zkApp or user data, execute the following:

```
python3 scripts/get_mina_state.py --output=mina_zkapp_state.json account --address B62qp64bbYKBnSuNa7yHHu7UpqPivao9TWwrH11Bs5gT1DPRXvwHRuY
```

_replace "B62qp......" with the public key of your zkApp/user account (i.e. `berkeley.json`_  for zkApp and `user.json` for users account)

The output file contains the following structure detailing the account/zkApp state.

```json
{
              "zkappState": [
                   "2",
                   "4",
                   "6",
                   "8",
                  "10",
                  "12",
                  "14",
                  "16"
              ],
              "balance": {
                  "liquid": "48900000000",
                  "locked": "0",
                  "stateHash": "3NKVQGUedEspG3RVUZTTr8fLZuZDJM9Ly7rWG4eM89VRmRR8F5kn"
             },

}

```

This will be used in the validation of the account proof in the smart contract.

## 2. Send Proof Request

Please navigate to the `proof-market-toolchain` home directory.

We need two proofs of this data to be validated in EVM.&#x20;

We can get all circuits on the proof market via&#x20;

```
python3 scripts/statement_tools.py get
```

Output:

```json
{
    .....
    "_key": "32292",
     "description": "mina state proof",
     "url": "https://github.com/NilFoundation/mina-state-proof"
},
{
    .....
    "_key": "79169223",    
    "description": "Account state proof for Mina",
    "url": "https://github.com/NilFoundation/mina-state-proof"
}
```

* The \_key `32292` is the mina ledger proof circuit key, this is used for Ledger state proof
* The \_key `79169223` is the mina account state proof circuit key, this is used for Account state proof

### Ledger State Proof

This proof validates the full ledger state. This is requested by executing the following:

```
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py push --cost <cost of the bid> --file mina_ledger_state.json --key <key of the statement> 
```

* _key:_ Mina circuit key&#x20;
* _cost :_ Cost of ordering proof&#x20;

ex:

```sh
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py push --cost 10 --file ../mina-state-proof/mina_ledger_state.json --key 32292
```

Output

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>{
</strong>   "_key":"65017881",
   "statement_key":"32292",
   "status" : "created"
    ....
}
</code></pre>

_Note the \_key of your bid. We will use this to retrieve proof or check the status of the order._

The key of our order is `65017881` , and the status is `created`

### Account state Proof

This proof validates the Merkle path of the user state to the above ledger state hash.  This is requested by executing the following.&#x20;

```
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py push --cost <cost of the bid> --file mina_zkapp_state.json --key <key of the statement> 
```

ex:

```
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py push --cost 10 --file ../mina-state-proof/mina_zkapp_state.json --key 79169223
```

Output

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>{
</strong>   "_key":"727121",
   "statement_key":"79169223",
   "status" : "created"
    ....
}
</code></pre>

_Note the \_key of your bid. We will use this to retrieve proof or check the status of the order._

The key of our order is `727121` , and the status is `created`

## 3. Get Proof

You must wait until your order status changes form `created` to `completed.`

Order status evolves as follows

1. `created` : Order is placed on the order book
2. `processing` : Order is matched, and proof is being generated
3. `completed` : Order is now fulfilled, and the proof has been submitted.

Your order status can be checked by executing:

```
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py get --key=<key of your order>
```

### Ledger State Proof

Once your order status is completed, you can retrieve the proofs. Note the _proof\_key,_ as we will be using this to retrieve the proof.

```sh
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py get --key=6501788
```

Output

```json
{
         "proof_key" : 44958982 
         "status": "completed",
}
```

Get Ledger Proof

```sh
python3 scripts/proof_tools.py get -p 44958982 -f ledger_proof.bin
```

_p:_ Is the proof key.

_f:_ is the file where we want the proof to be saved.

### Account state Proof

Same as above , we will fetch the Account state proof once order status is complete.

```sh
python3 scripts/bid_tools.py get --key=727121
```

Output

```json
{
         "proof_key" : 542042,
         "status": "completed",
}
```

Get Ledger Proof

```sh
python3 scripts/proof_tools.py get -p 542042 -f account_proof.bin
```

_p:_ Is the proof key.

_f:_ is the file where we want the proof to be saved.
