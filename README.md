# =nil; Proof Market (PoC)

# Introduction

This repository serves as a PoC of how a nil foundation supported proof market would operate.

The marketplace consists of the following entities.
- Proof Requester : This can be an application like a bridge requesting 
balance or a user interested in cross cluster operation and/or trust-less data access.
- Proof Generator : This is an entity who will generate the proofs for the requests/orders
made by the Proof Requester.

Below we will list a set of operations a user can follow along which demonstrates the market 
operation interaction between the above two entities.

# Proof Market Interaction

## 1. Circuit Generation/Publishing

Circuits can be generated by any one. They are serialised &  published on the proof market. 
This allows for reuse of the circuits by all other proof requesters. (TODO Check). Circuits need a set 
of public inputs. Below we create a new circuit and public params for it.

1.1  Create a new Circuit
```
cmake -build PATH_BUILD --target crypto3_placeholder_proof_gen_circuit_serialization_unified_addition_example -- -j 16
```

Execute the following to get a serialised json of circuit

```
PATH_BUILD/libs/placeholder-proof-gen/example/crypto3_placeholder_proof_gen_circuit_serialization_unified_addition_example
```

This circuit can now be pushed to the Proof market via curl command

**Request**

```
CURL --basic --user “root:” -X POST http://try.dbms.nil.foundation/circuit
{
  json output from above
}
```

**Response** (TODO : Check how additional params are in resp)
```
{
   "id": unique_id_of_circuit, 
   "name": "solana_state_proof"
   "repository": "https://github.com/NilFoundation/solana-state-proof"
   "info": "State Proof"
   "describe": "Circuit generates state proof for solana"
   "lambda": Lambda,
   "public_assignment": public_assignment,
   "desc": desc,
   "bp": bp
}
```


1.2 Add public params to circuit


Build
```
cmake  --build PATH_BUILD --target crypto3_placeholder_proof_gen_public_params_serialization_unified_addition_example  -- -j 16
```
Execute
```
/Users/zerg/Projects/solana/cmake-build-relwithdebinfo/libs/placeholder-proof-gen/example/crypto3_placeholder_proof_gen_public_params_serialization_unified_addition_example
```

## 2. Proof Market Order Creation

Once we have the artifacts/response from (1.1) && (1.2). The proof requester can create an order. Order
has additional details such as who is requesting the proof , what are they willing to pay for it and
how long is this order open to accept proposals from proof generators.

**Request**
```
CURL --basic --user “root:” -X POST http://try.dbms.nil.foundation/order
{
  "circuit_id": unique_id_of_circuit, // see 1.1 Response 
  "public_input": public_input  // see 1.2  TODO : how is this added here?
  "sender": pubkey, // Address of proof requestor (Hex) 
  "wait_period": time // how long will order stay open to accept proposals TODO : Should add fees?
}
```

**Response**
```
{
  "order_id": unique_order_id,
  "status": "registered",
  "circuit_id": unique_id_of_circuit,
  "public_input": public_input
  "sender": pubkey,
  "wait_period": time
  "proposal": Null,
  "proof": Null, 
}
```
This proof request is now visible to all proof generators.



## 3. Wait for proposals
Here the proof requester waits for proposals to be submitted against this order until
`wait_period` elapses or the requester finds a proposal they are happy with.



## 4. Submit Proposals
While the proposal is up, we now view at the marketplace from the perspective of a 
proof generator. In steps 1-3 , the requester put out an order. Now the generator can
observe them in the marketplace and start replying with proposals.

**Request**
```
CURL --basic --user “root:” -X POST http://try.dbms.nil.foundation/proposal
{
  "sender": pubkey, // Request generators payout address
  "bid": 225, // cost
  "order": unique_order_id, // id of order see 2.
  "eval_time": 1111, // proof geneation time in secs
}
```

**Response**









# Common issues

## Compilation Errors
If you have more than one compiler installed i.e g++ & clang++. The make system might pick up the former. You can explicitly force usage of
clang++ by finding the path and passing it in the variable below.

```
`which clang++`  
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path to clang++ from above>
```

## Submodule management
Git maintains a few places where submodule details are cached. Sometimes updates do not come through. ex: Deletion , updating
a url of a previously checked out submodule.It is advisable to check these locations for remains or try a new checkout.
- .gitmodules
- .git/config
- .git/modules/*
